## Administration aplication for a travel agency

Depending on their role, users can be either clients or administrators. Clients can use the application to schedule their next vacation as they wish, being able to choose various destinations, along with their own hotels and transportation options within the limits of their accessibility. Of course, they will also have access to a series of ready-made offers for visiting various locations in the available countries. The administrator will be able to change the availability of various services (both accommodation and transportation). Additionally, they will have access to the catalog of bookings recorded in the database, being able to change their status as needed.

## Objectives

## Architecture

For the user interface I used the Java Swing framework and for storing the data MySQL was used.
